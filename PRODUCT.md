# Nooble

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Stack

Dependency-free HTML, CSS and browser JavaScript, with a small Node.js static build script. Google Identity Services supports the optional Web OAuth upload preview. Python and native ComfyUI nodes execute workflows on Colab. The existing Rust egui/eframe desktop source remains available. The browser is the primary interface; editable Google Colab notebooks remain the core output and can be used directly. The Windows v0.2.0 companion is preserved as an optional legacy interface.

## Users

People who want to generate media with open-weight MiniMax H3 using a Colab GPU, without manually editing or uploading a raw notebook.

## Product Purpose

Guide users through template → settings → export/upload in a browser. Nooble is a free, open-source notebook builder: all templates and customization controls are available without subscriptions or feature tiers. Downloads stay editable. Users select their own Colab runtime and run the cells there.

## Operating Context

The existing repository has an original H3 FL2VA eight-step notebook with one successful GPU run and five curated presets with offline checks. On November 8, 2026, the user retired the subscription proposal in favor of a free, open-source personal project. Voluntary Ko-fi donations may be added later; no donation account is connected. Optional browser Drive upload uses a user-supplied Web application client ID and authorized JavaScript origin. The legacy desktop flow uses its separate Desktop OAuth configuration.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- First catalog: H3 text-to-video, image-to-video and reference-image-to-video, using the verified native ComfyUI graphs.
- Other model families and arbitrary ComfyUI graph imports are future work.
- The browser and legacy desktop application configure notebooks; inference runs on the user's Colab account.
- No Google tokens or local Windows image paths enter exported notebooks.
- Browser projects retain up to 20 configurations on the device, including image filenames; image files and tokens are not persisted. There is no cloud sync.
- Browser Google login uses Google Identity Services and the drive.file scope. Tokens stay in page memory. Upload creates a private Drive folder with the notebook and selected image.
- Initial defaults are text-to-video, FL2VA Turbo 8, 1344×768, requested 5 seconds and seed 12345. Image/reference workflows, five presets and advanced controls are available to everyone.
- Runtime control, arbitrary workflow imports, accounts and billing are outside the current browser preview.
- Runtime availability, model terms and GPU memory constraints apply. Repository licensing does not replace Colab terms or the MiniMax H3 license's territory and use conditions; see docs/SAAS.md.

## Brand Commitments

The application and repository are named Nooble, spelled N-O-O-B-L-E. The notebook remains central in the product explanation; the browser provides the primary guided interface. Keep visible MiniMax H3 attribution. The user rejected the former yellow browser UI and explicitly requested inspiration from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Eloqwnt](https://www.eloqwnt.com/): calm editorial typography, an airy geometric interface, green/white surfaces and restrained navigation. This reference direction governs the browser; the native Windows companion retains its separate legacy system.

## Evidence on Hand

The user generated an H3 clip with the original Colab notebook. Browser exporter checks cover safe prompt quoting, exact unsigned 64-bit seeds, clean six-cell notebooks and input validation; exported Python cells compile. Drive requests have offline mocked checks. Live browser Google authorization, uploads and new GPU paths remain unverified. No production OAuth credentials or billing are supplied. Prior desktop code and its release are preserved.

## Product Principles

1. Preserve a usable, editable notebook without the browser or desktop app.
2. Guide configuration with supported templates and meaningful defaults.
3. Keep media and credentials private until the user chooses export/upload.
4. Make the transition into Colab explicit and recoverable.
