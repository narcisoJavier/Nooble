# Nooble — MiniMax H3 notebook builder for Google Colab

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/narcisoJavier/Nooble/blob/main/MiniMax_H3_Colab.ipynb)

Prepare editable **Google Colab** notebooks for AI video generation with sound using open-weight **MiniMax H3** and ComfyUI. Configure text-to-video, first-frame image-to-video or reference-image workflows, five model presets and compatible LoRAs. Generation runs in your own Colab account.

**Status: free, open-source builder preview.** Only the original Turbo 8 workflow at 864×480 has a recorded successful GPU run. The refactored runtime, 1344×768 default, other workflows and live browser Drive integration still need end-to-end validation.

**The notebook is the core output.** The browser builder is Nooble's primary interface for preparing it. All templates and customization controls are free, with no subscription or feature tiers. You can also open the notebook above and configure it directly. ComfyUI runs in your own Colab runtime; the optional [Windows v0.2.0 companion](#optional-windows-desktop-companion) remains available.

Previously named **GoobleLab**. The v0.2.0 Windows release retains its original ZIP and executable names. Existing browser projects and notebook metadata retain their legacy storage keys for compatibility; the hosted preview URL also stays the same.

## Browser builder preview

[Open Nooble — public web preview](https://gooblelab-notebook-builder.helpfulaisle2.chatgpt.site) · [Vercel deployment](docs/WEB.md#deploy-on-vercel) · [Project direction](docs/SAAS.md)

Build and serve the browser app from the repository root:

```sh
node web/build.mjs
python -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory web/dist
```

Open [Nooble locally](http://127.0.0.1:8765/), choose a text, image or reference workflow, customize its settings, and download an editable notebook. All five model presets, resolution, duration, seed and compatible LoRA controls are available without payment. Projects stay in this browser, with no image files or Google tokens persisted.

Free refers to the builder, not included Google compute: this notebook targets an A100, high RAM and roughly 50 GB of storage. Suitable Colab resources and storage are your responsibility and may cost money.

See the [browser guide](docs/WEB.md) for the optional Web OAuth Drive upload preview and [project direction](docs/SAAS.md) for validation priorities. Voluntary donations may be added later; no donation account is currently connected. Live Google authorization and upload remain unverified.

## Quick start

1. Open the notebook above and save a copy to your Drive.
2. Choose **Runtime → Change runtime type → A100 GPU** with **high RAM**. The notebook checks for at least **38,000 MiB GPU memory** and **48 GiB system RAM**. GPU availability and paid compute depend on your Colab account.
3. Choose your preset before setup, then run Steps 1–4 in order. Allow **50 GB of free storage** for one model set and headroom. A Turbo set downloads approximately **44.4 GB**. Keeping both model families adds a **20.96 GB diffusion checkpoint**, plus any additional Turbo adapters; the text encoder and VAEs are shared.
4. In Step 5, edit the prompt and settings, then run the cell. The default is **1344×768**, approximately **5.17 seconds**, at 24 fps. The cell shows the saved path and a video preview.
5. Generate more clips with Step 5. When finished, enable `STOP_BACKEND` and run Step 6, then use **Runtime → Disconnect and delete runtime** to release the Colab GPU. Step 6 leaves the backend running while its switch is off.

After changing the preset or LoRA source in Step 1, rerun Step 1 and then Steps 3 and 4 before generating. With Drive enabled, the model cache is **My Drive → ComfyUI_Models** and MP4s appear under **My Drive → ComfyUI_Outputs → MiniMaxH3_[timestamp]**. Without Drive, files live under `/content/H3_models` and `/content/H3_outputs` and are temporary.

## Optional Windows desktop companion

The browser is the primary interface for new work; this optional legacy desktop release remains available.

[Download GoobleLab v0.2.0 for Windows x64 (legacy)](https://github.com/narcisoJavier/Nooble/releases/download/v0.2.0/GoobleLab-v0.2.0-windows-x64.zip) · [Release notes](https://github.com/narcisoJavier/Nooble/releases/tag/v0.2.0) · [Desktop guide](docs/DESKTOP.md)

Extract the portable ZIP and run `gooblelab.exe`. The Rust app guides you through **Template → Settings → Export & upload**:

1. Choose one of three curated H3 templates: text to video, image to video, or reference to video.
2. Set the matching preset, prompt, resolution, duration, seed and optional custom LoRA. Image templates require a PNG, JPEG or WebP input.
3. **Save notebook…** exports an editable `.ipynb` without Google credentials. Upload it in Colab; image templates ask you to upload the image in Step 5, without embedding a Windows path.
4. Alternatively, follow the [Google OAuth setup guide](docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH.md), select your own **Desktop OAuth client JSON**, and sign in through your system browser. **Upload to Drive & open Colab** creates a fresh private project folder containing the notebook and selected image, then opens Colab. The app requests only `drive.file`; tokens stay in memory for the current app session.

You still choose the GPU and run the cells in Colab. The companion needs no local GPU and does not accelerate GPU generation or guarantee Colab resources. It supports these curated templates; arbitrary ComfyUI workflows and other model families are not imported.

## MiniMax H3 presets

| Preset ID | Steps | Sampler | Video/audio sigma shift | Image |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `fl2va-turbo-8` (default) | 8 | res_multistep | 12 / 3 | Optional first frame |
| `fl2va-base` | 20 | res_multistep | 12 / 3 | Optional first frame |
| `fl2va-turbo-4` | 4 | euler | 6 / 3 | Optional first frame |
| `ref2va-base` | 20 | res_multistep | 12 / 3 | Required single reference |
| `ref2va-turbo-4` (experimental) | 4 | euler | 12 / 3 | Required single reference |

FL2VA is the starting choice for text-to-video generation. For image input in the direct notebook, set `INPUT_IMAGE` to a PNG, JPEG, or WebP path accessible inside Colab, such as `/content/drive/MyDrive/reference.png`. A Windows path cannot be read by Colab. Ref2VA requires this image; refer to it as **`<Picture 1>`** in the prompt. Turbo presets include the matching acceleration LoRA. The experimental Ref2VA 4-step adapter was trained at 544p; try **960×544** for that preset. Results and runtime depend on the prompt, settings, and allocated GPU.

The notebook uses FP8-pruned diffusion weights, an NVFP4 text encoder, and an FP16 video VAE. It targets an A100 Colab runtime and does not promise free-tier compatibility. **1344×768 is the default native landscape preset**, not an upscaler.

## Use a custom LoRA

In Step 1, set the optional `CUSTOM_LORA` field to either:

- A Hugging Face file URL: `https://huggingface.co/OWNER/REPO/resolve/REVISION/FILE.safetensors`.
- An absolute local path, such as `/content/drive/MyDrive/my_h3_lora.safetensors`.

After editing the source, rerun Step 1 and then Steps 3 and 4. Set `CUSTOM_LORA_STRENGTH` in Step 5. Leave the source blank to use only the chosen preset's built-in adapter. Public downloads need no token. For a private or gated custom adapter, add `HF_TOKEN` in **Colab Secrets** and grant notebook access; never put tokens in URLs or notebook fields. Hugging Face branch revisions are resolved to a commit for the current download.

Choose a **ComfyUI-compatible model-only LoRA trained for the selected H3 family**. FL2VA and Ref2VA adapters are not interchangeable; LoRAs for other architectures such as Wan, Flux, or Stable Diffusion do not work here. Custom LoRA loading applies an existing adapter; this notebook does not train one. Check the adapter's model card for its recommended strength, trigger words, and license.

## Output and recovery

- **Video saved, preview failed:** the MP4 may already be complete. Use the printed path. In a new cell, run `display(Video(str(last_video), embed=True))` after importing `Video` and `display` from `IPython.display`.
- **Connection refused / backend stopped:** rerun Step 4, wait for readiness, then run Step 5. Step 6 stops the backend when `STOP_BACKEND` is enabled.
- **Out of memory:** reduce resolution or duration, restart the backend, and retry. Maximum resolution is more demanding than the smaller test settings.
- **Runtime disconnected:** reconnect and rerun setup/startup. Cached Drive files and saved Drive outputs remain; files stored only under `/content` can be lost.

Each generation also saves `workflow_api.json`, which includes the prompt and settings. Exported notebooks contain your prompt too. Removing a local project or disconnecting Google does not remove downloaded files, Drive projects, model caches or generated outputs. See [where data lives and how to remove it](docs/WEB.md#where-data-lives-and-how-to-remove-it) before sharing notebooks or diagnostics.

## Project status

The original FL2VA 8-step notebook generated a video at 864×480 in the author's Colab session. **That clip is the only GPU-validated path so far.** The refactored runner, other presets, custom-LoRA loading, image/reference paths and 1344×768 default have offline checks but still need GPU validation. The desktop exporter and OAuth helpers also have offline checks; live Google sign-in and Drive upload have not yet been tested. Local checks do not establish generation quality, GPU compatibility or end-to-end Google integration.

Please include the selected preset, GPU, settings and relevant log excerpt when reporting an [issue](https://github.com/narcisoJavier/Nooble/issues). Remove tokens and private paths before posting logs.

## Development

[`MiniMax_H3_Colab.ipynb`](MiniMax_H3_Colab.ipynb) provides the forms, [`runner.py`](runner.py) handles setup and generation, [`presets.json`](presets.json) lists the model presets, and [`desktop/`](desktop/) contains the optional Rust companion. The v0.2.0 notebook loads its runner from the matching release tag. Support for other open-weight video models is a future goal after the MiniMax H3 workflow is stable.

With Python 3.10+ and Node.js 22+, run the core offline release checks:

```sh
python scripts/check.py
```

This runs Python and browser tests, builds the browser and syntax-checks eight exported notebooks across all five presets. It does not install packages, download model weights, use credentials or execute GPU inference. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for runtime release/versioning rules. Hosted CI is not configured yet.

To build and run the desktop app on Windows, install Rust **1.95 or newer** with the Windows MSVC build tools, then run from the repository root:

```powershell
cargo run --release --manifest-path desktop/Cargo.toml
```

Run its offline checks with `cargo test --manifest-path desktop/Cargo.toml`. See the [desktop guide](docs/DESKTOP.md) for export and build details.
